			<h5>General</h5>
			<p>Your task is to redesign a few key pages of the Prepr
			Network.</p>
			<p>Reimagine and create frontend webpages of the following
			pages (and possible sub-pages):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Explore page (https://preprlabs.org/)</li>
				<li>Projects page (https://preprlabs.org/myProjects)</li>
				<li>Challenges page (https://preprlabs.org/list/challenge)</li>
				<li>Challenge details page (https://preprlabs.org/challengeManager/front-end-developer-work-challenge)</li>
				<li>Labs page (https://preprlabs.org/joinedLab)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Do not be restrained by the current design and layout of
			the pages. However, do ensure that pages can perform their
			respective functions. Feel free to add additional details
			and functions, anything that you believe will result in the
			best user experience.</p>
			<p>(eg. In the explore page, each challenge card can contain
			more information than just the description)</p>
			<p>You may use any frontend technologies you want. You do
			not need to create any backend functionality (you can
			hardcode details and images into the web pages).</p>
